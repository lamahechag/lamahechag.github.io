I am a Physicist, who is very curious about complex systems, statistical physics, information theory, statistical misleading, and history of science.

I write this blog as an exercise for my own understanding of complex topics I have been wondering about:
the multiple meanings of information and entropy, causal modelling, and statistical physics as general framework for any system. Here, I also aim to expose the mathematical deduction steps; to give a deeper understanding, and the hints for the numerical implementations of the topics mentioned above.
