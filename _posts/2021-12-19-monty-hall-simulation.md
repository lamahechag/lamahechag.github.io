In the MOnty hall game you have three doors and one of them has a car. By deifinition you ar goin to fail 66% of the time.
Noe suppose that there is a game presenter that after you choce a door, he opens another door that does not contain the car, and give you
the choice to change the door.

66% of time the presenter is going to have just one door option to open, that means thet he door left closed is the one that has the car.
So your best option is to change the door.
