In Bayes curve fitting we have an inference about coefficients posteriory distributions, and the prediction distribution given
training data and new predictors datapoints.

Maximizingthe posterior distribution of coefficients will rise the term of Ridge regression.
$ P(h|D) = \frac{P(D|h) P(h)}{P(D)} $
