In statistical mechanics the objective is to predict simple macroscopic rules from complex microscopic interactions.
In the other hand, complex theory predicts complex macroscopic behavior from simple microscopic rules.he observer
- The order depends on the perspective of the observer.

$ s = -k \ln\omega $
$ H = -\sum p\ln(p)$

What is the relation of teh definition of irrersivility and the assimetry in Bayes rule.
$ P(h|D) = \frac{P(D|h) P(h)}{P(D)} $
